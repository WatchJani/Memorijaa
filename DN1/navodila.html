    <p> On the game board, there are always two identical images. Start the game by flipping a card. 
        Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down.  
        Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play.
        When you find a pair they are removed from the board and when you find all the pairs in this memory, you have completed the level.</p>
    <p>The game is played on a board with a number of cards. The cards are numbered from 1 to n. The number of cards on the board is n. </p>
